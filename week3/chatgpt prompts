1- okay i will provide you a code for mood tracker, i just need you to read it and when you are done tell me done.
answer: done

2- what did you understand from the previous code ?
answer:
The provided code is a mood tracker program where a user can input their mood for each day of the week. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

User Input:

It prompts the user for their name and age.
It asks for confirmation by inputting "yes" to proceed. If not confirmed, it asks the user to reenter their details.
Mood Collection:

The program then asks the user to input their mood for each day of the week (Saturday to Friday).
It stores the mood input for each day in a dictionary called moods.
Mood Display:

After collecting all the moods for the week, it prints out the mood for each day.
Mood Counting:

The program then counts how many times each mood was selected using a dictionary called mood_counts.
Mood Percentage Calculation:

Finally, it calculates the percentage of each mood for the week based on the number of days it occurred and prints out the result in percentage form.
